Main functionalities provided by this API:
- Create agents with specific instructions and ability to use tools.
- Interactions with agents are grouped into sessions ("threads"), and each interaction is called a "turn".
- Agents can be provided with various tools (see the ToolGroups and ToolRuntime APIs for more details).
- Agents can be provided with various shields (see the Safety API for more details).
- Agents can also use Memory to retrieve information from knowledge bases. See the RAG Tool and Vector IO APIs for more details.
